<h3>You are allowed to link to this video on your private and commercial sites.</h3>

<p>The author of the video, by posting it on YouTube, by default, agrees to place it on private websites of other people and companies. If not, it is possible to block it at any time.
    However, it is a good idea to get some additional permission from the author of the video to include the video on your website. It can be obtained by sending an email to the author of the film. However, this is a long procedure that requires extra work for both parties. It is much easier if the author of the video publishes such consent under the film.
    This text is only a brief view and does not exhaust the entire topic. There are many studies on this topic on the Internet, to be sure, please read them more.</p>
